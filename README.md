# Implementation-of-Multiple-Channel-Active-Noise-Control
In this project, filtered-X LMS algorithm is incorporated to emulate a better performance over its normal version siblings. A traditional single-channel ANC(SCANC) is juxtaposed with a multiple-channel ANC(MCANC) to showcase the feasibility of MCANC in space and probability of MCANC's dominance over SCANC in future use.

Details are provided with pictures and comments in codes.
